# 🐶 Virtual Pet App (SwiftUI)

This is a simple **virtual pet app** built with **SwiftUI**. It features a cute pet dog and interactive stats for **Hunger**, **Happiness**, and **Energy**. These stats decrease over time, and the player can interact with the pet using buttons to maintain its well-being.

  Every 3 seconds, a random stat decreases — keep your pet healthy!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**
- **Timer API** for real-time simulation
- **State Management** using `@State`

## 🧪 How It Works

- All stats start at predefined levels:
  - Hunger: `5/10`
  - Happiness: `8/10`
  - Energy: `7/10`

- Stats range from `0` to `10`.

- Timer triggers every 3 seconds to simulate natural stat decay.

- Interact with buttons to keep your pet happy and healthy!
